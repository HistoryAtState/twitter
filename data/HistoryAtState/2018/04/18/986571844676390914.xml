    <html>RT <a href="https://twitter.com/Bush41Library">@Bush41Library</a>: With the passing of
        Barbara Bush we say goodbye to a wonderful First Lady, mother, author and advocate for
        universal literacy. Barbara has meant so much to so many and her memories and life will
        continue to shine throughout the Bush Presidential Library and Museum (1/3). <a
