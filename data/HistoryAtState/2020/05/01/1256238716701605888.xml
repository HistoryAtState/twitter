    <html>RT <a href="https://twitter.com/FSIatState">@FSIatState</a>: (2/2) Reports like these
        served as notices for mariners, and <a href="https://twitter.com/StateDept">@StateDept</a>
        utilized this info to apprise merchant ships about which ports to avoid. U.S. officials also
        negotiated w/ foreign governments when they banned entry of U.S. vessels as a preventative
        measure. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FSIatHome&amp;src=hash"
