    <html>RT <a href="https://twitter.com/StateDept">@StateDept</a>: We mourn the loss of George P.
        Shultz, the 60th Secretary of State whose life and legacy has inspired a generation of
        diplomats. Under his leadership, U.S. diplomacy helped to pave the way for the ending of the
        Cold War. We offer deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. <a
