    <html>RT <a href="https://twitter.com/USEmbassyCairo">@USEmbassyCairo</a>: Lafrance entered the
        U.S. Diplomatic Service as an Office Management Specialist in 1946, at a time when there
        were few women in the U.S. Department of State. Jeannette tragically died in Cairo 67 years
        ago today and we pause to remember and honor her life and legacy.</html>
