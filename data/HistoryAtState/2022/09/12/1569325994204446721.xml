Address by President Reagan to the Nation and Other Countries,” dated Jan. 16, 1984: “Just suppose…an Ivan and Anya could find themselves…sharing a shelter from the rain or a storm with a Jim and Sally…Would they then debate the differences between their respective governments? Or would they find themselves comparing notes about their children and what each other did for a living?”"
